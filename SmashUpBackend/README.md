I have finished the basic structure of the backend, but still need to finalize details, and implement repos.

The next steps are:
- Finalize Game, Battle, Table relationship. Figure out what the frontend is actually calling, and what is handling turns
- Implement Prototype pattern for cards
- Implement repos/data storage






Why Event Approach?
At this point I have questioned the API approach, since events seems easier to implement, though the coupling will be much tighter than an API.
If I think I will make this online, or use a different UI then it seems like an API may be a better approach, but for a proof of concept
events seem so much easier and faster.
